# Stock Analysis


## Purpose

This analysis is meant to take data from the last several years of the stock market, focusing on 12 specific stocks. Using the written code, each stocks' total daily trade volume and over all annual return can be caluculated by putting in the year in question. The code was originally written but to make it run more effeciently, a refactored version of the script was generated.

## Results

I started by pulling the output sheet set up code and ticker array from Sub AllStockAnalysis as shown here:

I then created a tickerIndex, setting it to zero. Ticker volumes were calculated by checking rows for tickerIndexes and increasing the volume each time a tickerIndex was found:
